## My process

- I started with the phone Design first because I saw it was the hardest
- I did the background design and then I decided to see how it works in responsive mode
- I fixed all the problems with responsive mode 
- I did the paragraph in the end to finish it all

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```html
<section></section>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  z-index:-1;
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to continue development on type of Displays and when to use FlexBox or grid layout
- I want to continue development on media Quereys and responsive layouts
- I want to continue development on Sass and JavaScript layouts so that will help me to make more effective and organized pages
- I want to see the influnce of creating a background design
